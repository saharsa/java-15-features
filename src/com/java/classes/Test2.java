/*
An interface is an abstract data type are that declares a list of abstract methods that any class implementing the interface must provide. An interface can also include constant variables. Both abstract methods and constant variables included with an interface are implicitly assumed to be public.
With Java 8, interfaces were updated to include static and default methods.
A default method is one in which the interface method has a body and is not marked abstract.
It was added for backward compatibility, allowing an older class to use a new version of an interface that contains a new method, without having to modify the existing class.
In Java 9, interfaces were updated to support private and private static methods.
Both of these types were added for code reusability within an interface declaration and cannot be called outside the interface definition.

public static final implicit modifiers for variable

/*
Differences between abstract classes and interfaces

Even though abstract classes and interfaces are both considered abstract types, only interfaces make use of implicit modifiers.
This means that an abstract class and interface with similar declarations may have very different properties.
An interface can extend multiple interface
The primary differences between the two are that interfaces include implicit modifiers, do not contain constructors, do not participate in the instance initialization process, and support multiple inheritance.

/*
Interface Definition Rules

Interfaces cannot be instantiated.
All top-level types, including interfaces, cannot be marked protected or private.
Interfaces are assumed to be abstract and cannot be marked final.
Interfaces may include zero or more abstract methods.
An interface can extend any number of interfaces.
An interface reference may be cast to any reference that inherits the interface, although this may produce an exception at runtime if the classes arenâ€™t related.
The compiler will only report an unrelated type error for an instanceof operation with an interface on the right side if the reference on the left side is a final class that does not inherit the interface.
An interface method with a body must be marked default, private, static, or private static (covered when studying for the 1Z0-816 exam).
The following are the five rules for abstract methods defined in interfaces.

Abstract Interface Method Rules

Abstract methods can be defined only in abstract classes or interfaces.
Abstract methods cannot be declared private or final.
Abstract methods must not provide a method body/implementation in the abstract class in which is it declared.
Implementing an abstract method in a subclass follows the same rules for overriding a method, including covariant return types, exception declarations, etc.
Interface methods without a body are assumed to be abstract and public.
The first four rules for abstract methods, whether they be defined in abstract classes or interfaces, are exactly the same.

Interface Variables Rules

Interface variables are assumed to be public, static, and final.
Because interface variables are marked final, they must be initialized with a value when they are declared.
