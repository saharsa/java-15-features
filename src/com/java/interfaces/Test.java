  A default method is a method defined in an interface with the default keyword and includes a method body.
  A default method may be overridden by a class implementing the interface.

  One motivation for adding default methods to the Java language was for backward compatibility. A default method allows you to add a new method to an existing interface, without the need to modify older code that implements the interface.

  A default method may be declared only within an interface.
  A default method must be marked with the default keyword and include a method body.
  A default method is assumed to be public.
  A default method cannot be marked abstract, final, or static.
  A default method may be overridden by a class that implements the interface.
  If a class inherits two or more default methods with the same method signature, then the class must override the method.

By introducing six different interface member types, Java has certainly blurred the lines between an abstract class and an interface.
A key distinction, though, is that interfaces do not implement constructors and are not part of the class hierarchy.
While a class can implement multiple interfaces, it can only directly extend a single class.

A functional interface is an interface that contains a single abstract method
A lambda expression is a block of code that gets passed around, sort of like an anonymous class that defines one method
If a functional interface includes an abstract method with the same signature as a public method found in Object, then those methods do not count toward the single abstract method test.

Lambda expressions rely on the notion of deferred execution. Deferred execution means that code is specified now but runs later.
In this case, later is when the print() method calls it. Even though the execution is deferred, the compiler will still validate that the code syntax is correct.
